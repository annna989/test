<p><q>there's this passage I've got memorized that sort of fits this occasion. 
    Ezekiel 25:17. The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish 
    and the tyranny of the evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill, shepherds 
    the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper, and the finder of 
    lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who 
    attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.And you will 
    know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee</q></p>
